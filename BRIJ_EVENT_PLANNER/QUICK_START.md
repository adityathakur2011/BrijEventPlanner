# 🚀 Quick Start - Check Your Deployment Status

## Right Now - What to Do:

1. **Go to Actions Tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/adityathakur2011/BrijEventPlanner/actions
   ```

2. **Look for workflow:**
   - Workflow name: "Deploy Astro to GitHub Pages"
   - Status: Should show "In progress" or "Completed"

3. **Once it shows ✅ green checkmark:**
   - Go to: Settings → Pages
   - Your site will be live at:
   - **https://adityathakur2011.github.io/BrijEventPlanner/**

## Expected Timeline:

- ⏱️ 2-5 minutes total
  - Build: 2-3 minutes
  - Deploy: 1-2 minutes

## Troubleshooting:

If you see errors:
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Verify your `astro.config.mjs` has the correct base path

## Future Updates:

Every time you push to `main` branch, the site will automatically redeploy! ✨
